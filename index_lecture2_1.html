		&nbsp; So this one time, I was drunk with my  friends, right? and one of my friends was freshly expelled from school.
		<br>He was pissed (pun for later) at the school, and he had had a lot of alcohol that night, so he wanted to piss on the school wall.
		<br>However, I have him a better idea, I boosted him up on the wall of the school and he actually pissed inside.

		<br> &nbsp; So I went to the US right? and they have this place called New York City, small town.
		<br> they use &#36; there, that's the symbol of a dollar btw, i bought things with that.
		<br><br>&nbsp; &euro; is what they used in Paris when I went there, that is called a Euro.
		<br> Apparently it's a pretty popular currency in europe... weird.
		<br><br> &nbsp; oh, yea, there's also the british pound &pound; , it's pretty useless.
